# top-etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-Sketch project (The Odin Project Foundations) 

As of 26.12.2022, this fulfills 3 out of the 4 items of the assignment.
Compared to the proposed assignment, the project is currently missing the functionality for the user to determine how many squares (or "pixels") the grid will have.
It will be implemented together with more robust customization features as soon as I reach the end of the foundations course.
